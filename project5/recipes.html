            Puff Puff is a popular snack food in Nigeria. It is made by mixing flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and water to form a dough, which is then deep-fried in oil until it puffs up and turns golden brown. The result is a soft and fluffy doughnut-like snack that is often enjoyed with tea or coffee.
