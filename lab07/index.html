        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, writing poetry, and watching a slightly embarrassing amount of reality TV. I am very close with my mother and I have four brothers and one sister.  I have been interested in astrology since the 6th grade so I think a funny fact about me is that I’m a Pisces that doesn't know how to swim! However, my goal by the end of this year is to learn. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a hard working and organized student who takes pride in meeting deadlines. However, I like to think I am very flexible and creative as well!
