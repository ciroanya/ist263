        My name is Celeste Iroanya and I am a senior majoring in advertising who is interested in digital media planning and buying. I have been apart of Newhouse’s TNH Agency for two years and this year I am apart of Newhouse’s 2023 AAF team. I am Google Ads Search certified and Google Ads Measurement certified. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, writing poetry, and watching a slightly embarrassing amount of reality TV. I am very close with my mother and I have four brothers and one sister. I have been interested in astrology since the 6th grade so I think a funny fact about me is that I’m a Pisces that doesn't know how to swim! However, my goal by the end of this year is to learn.  I am a hard working and organized student who takes pride in meeting deadlines. However, I like to think I am very flexible and creative as well!
